# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset - Tidy version

## Overview
This dataset is a tidy version of the "Human Activity Recognition Using 
Smartphones Dataset". Detailed information about the experiment can be

## Background of the experiment
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers 
within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six 
activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, 
STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the 
waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 
3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant
 rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the 
 data manually.
 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by 
applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows 
of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor 
acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components,
 was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body 
 acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have 
 only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff 
 frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained
 by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
 
## Feature selection
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and 
gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain
 signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of
 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order 
 low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove
 noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body 
and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) 
using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 
0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were 
derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and 
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional 
signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, 
tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these 
signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, 
fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to 
indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
 
## Structure of the data file
Each row of the "summarized.txt" data file contains the average of each
feature that is the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, 
grouped by the subject and activity. The fields are separated by a 
single whitespace.

There are 68 fields in the file:
1. activity - the activity during which the measurements are collected. One of WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.
2. subject - the subject id performing the activity, ranged from 1 - 30.
3 - 68.  feature name and aggregation method. For example, fbodyaccjerkmeanx is the mean of the fBodyAccJerk-X variable.
